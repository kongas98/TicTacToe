# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This is a simple Python console-based game where you can play Tic-Tac-Toe against an opponent.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script in your Python environment.
2. You'll be prompted to choose whether you want to go first or second.
3. Select the cell number where you want to place your mark (X) when it's your turn.
4. The opponent (O) will then make its move automatically.
5. The game ends when either you or the opponent gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled.
6. You can choose to replay the game after it ends.
